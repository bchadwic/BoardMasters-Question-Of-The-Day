## Interview Questions

This is a collective table of technical questions people have had to do in an interview. The objective is to gauge what real life interviews are like, as well as the time they typically take. Feel free to add to the list with a pull request, the more data in the table, the better off applicants are!

### Notes

Company: feel more than welcome to leave this as a "-" to signify you are uncomfortable with sharing this info in a public repo

Question: give enough details to help the reader understand the problem, but don't feel required to spell every detail out

Language: list the language you used for the problem, if the interviewers gave you and option add a "~" to the beginning of the language name

Time Allowed: type the amount of time allowed for the problem(s) in hours formated as "\~.5 hr" where "~" means approximately

Date: give an estimate of when the interview took place starting with the month abbreviated, and the year

Profile: add in your profile, if you don't feel comfortable leaving a profile name, use a "-" instead. The reason to leave a profile is not to _show off_ the amount of interviews recieved, but rather to signify you are available to be contacted about this particular interview experience. (note: a profile will be shown by looking through the commit history)

| Company | Question | Language | Time Allowed | Date | Profile |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Dataminr | 3 questions: 1. Loop through a list of objects and tally up the amount of objects are valid based on a criteria given. 2. Given a matrix of numbers, determine what the value would be of a given cell, if you added up all the cells before it. This question needed memoization because this function was needed to run multiple times a second. 3 Problem using recursion, can't remember the specifics | ~Java | 1.5 hr | Feb. 2021 | [@bchadwic](https://github.com/bchadwic) |

| Stripe | Loop through a bunch of login request objects, determine if the login request is valid by the frequency of the login attempts. Several criteria needed to be met by the login to ensure the login was valid. This problem required a lot of conditional statements | ~Golang | ~1 hr | Sep. 2021 | [@bchadwic](https://github.com/bchadwic) | 
| - | 2 questions: 1. Convert a date string such as "Feb. 20th, 2003" to "02-20-03". The date passed in could be in a few formats as well. 2. Convert a Roman Numeral string to an int and return it | ~Java | ~1 hr | Feb. 2021| [@bchadwic](https://github.com/bchadwic) |
